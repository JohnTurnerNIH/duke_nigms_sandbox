    "Welcome to this tutorial on statistical analysis using R. In this notebook, we'll work through an experiment designed to test whether the neurotransmitter **norepinephrine** controls the formation of cardiac muscle cells in rats. This analysis will guide you through data loading, visualization, outlier detection, and various statistical tests, including t-tests and ANOVA.\n",

    "1. Load and inspect a dataset in R.\n",
    "2. Visualize data using box plots and line graphs.\n",
    "3. Detect and handle outliers appropriately.\n",
    "4. Perform t-tests and interpret p-values.\n",

    "## 1. Experiment Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cardiac muscle cells are formed during development and then permanently exit the mitotic cycle.\n",
    "- The experiment aims to test whether **norepinephrine** controls the formation of these cells.\n",
    "- Rats were studied from birth to 19 days of postnatal (PN) age, covering the progression from mitotic to postmitotic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experimental Design:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- On PN1 (Postnatal Day 1), pups received an injection of either **saline** (control) or **6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA)**, a neurotoxin that destroys norepinephrine neurons.\n",
    "- At various ages, mitotic activity in the heart was measured by injecting animals with radiolabeled thymidine.\n",
    "- After 30 minutes, tissues were analyzed for the amount of radiolabel incorporated into DNA relative to total uptake, providing an index of mitotic activity.\n",
    "- **Negative Controls:**\n",
    "  - **Liver DNA Synthesis:** Measured in the same animals to check if the effect is specific to the heart.\n",
    "  - **Protein Synthesis:** Measured in additional pups to see if the effect is specific to DNA synthesis.\n",
    "- **Measurements:**\n",
    "  - **Body Weight**\n",
    "  - **Heart DNA Synthesis (heart incorp/uptake)**\n",
    "  - **Liver DNA Synthesis (liver incorp/uptake)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does 6OHDA affect the mitotic activity of developing cardiac muscle cells?\n",
    "2. Is the effect specific to the heart (i.e., not shared by the liver)?\n",
    "3. Is the effect specific to DNA synthesis (i.e., not shared by protein synthesis)?\n",
    "4. Is the effect on cardiac DNA synthesis an artifact of reduced body weight caused by 6OHDA?\n",

    "\n",
    "First, let's take a look at what we need to accomplish:\n",
    "1. Create consistent column names\n",
    "2. Set appropriate data types\n",
    "3. Organize our columns logically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Creating Consistent Column Names\n",
    "First, let's change the column names to something more consistent and easy to work with. R works best with simple, descriptive names that:\n",
    "- Use lowercase letters\n",
    "- Replace spaces with underscores (snake_case)\n",
    "- Avoid special characters\n",
    "- Clearly describe the content\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "clean_data.df <- data.df %>%\n",
    " rename(\n",

    "   body_weight_g = \"bdy wt (g)\",\n",
    "   heart_ratio = \"heart incorp/uptake\",\n",
    "   liver_ratio = \"liver incorp/uptake\",\n",
    "   sample_number = \"#\"\n",
    " )\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Converting Data Types\n",
    "Next, we need to tell R how to interpret our data columns. This is crucial because:\n",
    "- Factors tell R that a variable is categorical (like treatment groups)\n",
    "- Numeric values are needed for calculations\n",
    "- Ordered factors maintain correct sequence (like age groups)\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "clean_data.df <- clean_data.df %>%\n",
    " mutate(\n",
    "   age_days = parse_number(age),          # Extract numbers from age\n",
    "   age_factor = fct_reorder(age, parse_number(age)),  # Order age groups correctly\n",
    "   treatment = factor(treatment),         # Treatment groups are categories\n",
    "   synthesis = factor(synthesis),         # Type of measurement is categorical\n",
    "   cohort = factor(cohort)               # Experimental batches are categories\n",
    " )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Organizing Columns\n",
    "Finally, let's arrange our columns in a logical order to make our data frame easier to work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "clean_data.df <- clean_data.df %>%\n",
    " select(\n",
    "   animal_id, treatment, cohort,          # Identifying information\n",
    "   age_days, age_factor, synthesis,       # Experimental variables\n",
    "   sample_number, body_weight_g,          # Additional measurements\n",
    "   heart_ratio, liver_ratio              # Our main outcome variables\n",
    " )\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Verify Our Work\n",
    "Always good practice to check the cleaned dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "`clean_data.df`\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Proper data cleaning and type setting is crucial for subsequent statistical analysis. Incorrect data types can lead to errors or misleading results in your analysis."

    "## Understanding Statistical Outliers in Biological Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Box Plot Method and Biological Context\n",
    "While statistical methods can identify potential outliers, biological data requires careful consideration beyond pure mathematics. The common box plot method provides a starting point, but should never be used as the sole criterion for data exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Detection Basics\n",
    "The box plot method uses these key components:\n",
    "- Q1: The 25th percentile\n",
    "- Q3: The 75th percentile\n",
    "- IQR: The Interquartile Range (Q3 - Q1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential outlier boundaries are calculated as:\n",
    "- Lower Boundary = Q1 - (1.5 Ã— IQR)\n",
    "- Upper Boundary = Q3 + (1.5 Ã— IQR)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Critical Considerations for Biological Data\n",
    "When evaluating potential outliers in biological data, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Biological Plausibility**\n",
    "  - Is the value physically or biologically possible?\n",
    "  - Example: Synthesis ratios cannot exceed 1.0\n",
    "  - Values outside known biological limits warrant investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Systematic Patterns**\n",
    "  - Look for consistent patterns across multiple measurements\n",
    "  - Example: An animal showing consistently small measurements across all parameters may be a runt, not an outlier\n",
    "  - Single unusual measurements from otherwise normal samples need special scrutiny\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Technical vs. Biological Variation**\n",
    "  - Technical outliers: Values that are impossible or result from clear measurement errors\n",
    "  - Biological outliers: Unusual but potentially valid biological variation\n",
    "  - Technical outliers can be removed with more confidence than biological outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices for Outlier Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Everything**\n",
    "  - Record all criteria used for outlier identification\n",
    "  - Note specific justification for each excluded datapoint\n",
    "  - Maintain transparency in publications about outlier handling\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conservative Approach**\n",
    "  - Only remove data points when you have strong biological or technical justification\n",
    "  - Consider reporting results both with and without outliers\n",
    "  - Be especially cautious with small sample sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Methods**\n",
    "  - Use statistical methods (like `identify_outliers` in rstatix) as screening tools only\n",
    "  - Combine statistical analysis with biological expertise\n",
    "  - Consider consulting subject matter experts for unusual cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warning Signs That Merit Investigation\n",
    "- Values outside physically possible ranges\n",
    "- Measurements that deviate drastically from established literature\n",
    "- Technical readings beyond instrument capabilities\n",
    "- Systematic differences across all measurements from a single subject\n",
    "- Unexplainable extreme values that don't fit known biological mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: It's better to include a potential outlier than to incorrectly exclude valid biological variation. Statistical outlier detection should guide investigation, not automatically determine exclusion."

    "# Efficient Outlier Detection Using Long Format Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with multiple physiological measurements per animal (heart_ratio, liver_ratio, body_weight_g), converting data to long format enables more precise outlier handling. The key advantage is the ability to selectively mark individual measurements as outliers while preserving other valid measurements from the same animal.\n",

    "Before removing outliers, we analyze their patterns to distinguish between technical anomalies and potentially meaningful biological variations. This analysis helps identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Individual animals with multiple outlier measurements, which could indicate:\n",
    "   - Biological phenomena (e.g., developmentally delayed \"runts\")\n",
    "   - Systematic measurement errors affecting multiple organs\n",
    "   - Sample handling issues during processing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Technical outliers that likely represent measurement errors:\n",
    "   - Organ-to-body ratios greater than 1 (physically impossible)\n",
    "   - Inconsistencies between adjacent measurements\n",
    "   - Values far outside the expected physiological range\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below creates a summary of outliers by:\n",
    "1. Calculating interquartile ranges (IQR) within each experimental group\n",
    "2. Showing the extreme outliers relative to these ranges\n",
    "3. Counting multiple outliers per animal\n",
    "4. Preserving contextual information (treatment, age, cohort) for interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary allows us to:\n",
    "- Review outliers in their experimental context\n",
    "- Identify animals with multiple anomalous measurements\n",
    "- Make informed decisions about outlier handling based on biological plausibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting `outlier_summary` dataframe provides a comprehensive view of potential outliers while maintaining the relationship between different measurements from the same animal."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The significant interaction proves that body weight reduction alone cannot explain the treatment effect on cardiac DNA synthesis. If the treatment effect was simply due to reduced body weight, we would expect parallel regression lines (no interaction). Instead, we find that treatment fundamentally alters how DNA synthesis relates to body weight, indicating a more complex biological effect beyond simple growth reduction."
